Rest API for mobile application **DailyTask**. DailyTask is the free mobile application that use gamification to improve quality of education.

## Short description
Our diploma is 'Gamification in education'. First thing that comes to mind when you hear education is something like school subjects or university courses. But by education we mean every kind of information that should be delivered to peoples. It doesnt matter is this information university course or guide for some techniques. By this way we made a mobile application where we apply some gamification elements. We choosed the religion studies as base for our project.
